The aim of this project was to design and build your own functioning browser based game using HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript.

Cat Attack is a card game I designed where you (the user) compete with the computer to be the first to reach a score of 5.
The rules are as follows:

1. Click on the card to be randomly assigned a cat card from the deck
2. Choose your method of attack by clicking the relevant checkbox (TIP: the higher your number, the better chance you have at winning!)
3. When you are happy with your choice of attack, press the duel button to reveal the computer's card and see if you won, drew or lost that round
4. Click the next round button to play as many rounds as it takes to get to 5 wins
5. Press the new game button to reset the deck and play again!
